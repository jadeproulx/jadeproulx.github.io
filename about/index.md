I obtained my Masters in Food Engineering at Cornell University, working under the supervision of <a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/"><span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span></a>. My <a href="http://www.jadeproulx.com/research"><span style="color:green">research</span></a> focused on developing novel strategies for the surface decontamination of foods using non-thermal technologies. I have industry <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51364198/Resume_Jade%20Proulx.pdf"><span style="color:green">experience</span></a> that includes internships in both Research & Development and Quality Control at two different flavour companies, as well as being <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51364198/HACCP-certificate.jpg"><span style="color:green">HACCP-certified</span></a>. I am currently a Product Development Scientist at Ocean Spray Cranberries. In my <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/freetime"><span style="color:green">free time</span></a>, I like being involved in entrepreneurial projects combining food and tech such as participating to <a href= "http://jadeproulx.com/freetime/popples"><span style="color:green">food product development competitions</span></a>, designing a <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/freetime/TFF"><span style="color:green">smart food inventory management system</span></a> for households, and co-founding an <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/freetime/Atlus"><span style="color:green">exclusive restaurant recommendation app</span></a>. My interests lie at the interface between <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>food</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.
