I am a Masters student in Food Science at Cornell University. My current work involves developing novel strategies for the surface decontamination of foods using non-thermal technologies. I have work experience in the food industry, having previously interned in both R&D and QC at two different flavour companies. I have also been involved in numerous food-related entrepreneurial projects such as [co-founding an exclusive restaurant recommendation app](http://atl.us), organizing a Gastronomy & Science symposium, and participating to [food product development competitions](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/07/snappy-popples-cracks-first-place-national-food-expo). My interests lie at the interface between **technology**, **food**, **sustainability**, and **entrepreneurship**.

## So Simple Theme is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 9+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* [Custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
