I am a Masters student in Food Science at Cornell University. My current work involves developing novel strategies for the surface decontamination of foods using non-thermal technologies. I have work experience in the food industry, having previously interned in both R&D and QC at two different flavour companies. I have also been involved in numerous food-related entrepreneurial projects such as co-founding an [<span style="color:green">exclusive restaurant recommendation app</span>](/freetime/Atlus), organizing a [<span style="color:green">Gastronomy & Science Symposium</span>](/freetime/mcgillsymposium), and participating to [<span style="color:green">food product development competitions</span>](freetime/popples). My interests lie at the interface between **technology**, **food**, **sustainability**, and **entrepreneurship**.
