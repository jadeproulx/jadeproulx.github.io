## IFTSA & Mars Product Development Competition (2014) 
As part of the Cornell team, I helped develop a novel extruded snack making use of apple pomace as a main ingredient, which is currently an under-utilized, nutrient-rich by-product of the juice and cider industry.

## Learning Code (2013-2014) 
I think computer literacy is a must nowadays, so I decided to learn any way I could, both from MOOCs and from Cornell classes I took for credit. I mostly have exposure to Python, R, and a little bit of Java.

## Roger Smith FoodTech Conference (2014)  
Since food science is so misunderstood, I decided to give an open talk at a conference in New York City where the theme was *An Exploration of Our Ambiguous Love, Hate, and Fear of Food Technologies*. I talked about High Pressure Processing (HPP) and UV-Pasteurization.

## Thought for Food Challenge (2013)  
TFF is a fast-growing community of students and mentors from all fields of study wanting to solve complex challenges related to food security. I participated to their annual challenge with a proposal for a smart domestic food management system.

## Atlus Inc. (2012)  
I co-founded Atlus, an exlusive restaurant recommendation iPhone app, along with 4 other students in the framework of <a href="http://thenext36.ca"><span style="color:green">The Next 36></span></a>, Canada's Entrepreneurial Leadership Initiative. The app was acquired in 2013 by Purple Forge Inc.
