Every year, the <a href="http://www.ift.org/community/students/competitions/product-development.aspx"><span style="color:green">IFTSA & MARS Product Development Competition</span></a> prompts food science students across North America to take the skills they learn in the classroom and use them to create a food product that is either new to the market of that overcomes a processing barrier that has previously restricted their entry in to the market.  
  
The 2013-2014 Cornell team that I was a part of won <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/07/snappy-popples-cracks-first-place-national-food-expo"><span style="color:green">1st place</span></a> for *Popples*, an extruded snack using apple pomace as a main ingredient, which is an under-utilized source of fiber that is normally diverted as animal feed. Pomace consists of the leftover pulp, skin, and seeds after apples are pressed for juice or cider production, and is in fact the most nutritious part of the apple.

*Popples* are an **excellent source of fiber**, contain **4g of proteins** per serving, and contain real apple micronutrients that are preserved by the use of <a href="http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/engineering-r-d-supercritical-co-sub-2-sub-extrusion-opens-new-product-opportunities"><span style="color:green">supercritical-CO<sub>2</sub> extrusion</span></a>, a processing technique allowing extrusion to take place at lower temperatures than its conventional counterpart. 

My role in the team was to take care of technical problem solving in terms of formulation design and scale-up, as well as ingredient and packaging sourcing.
