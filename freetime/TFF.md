I assembled a multidisciplinary <a href="http://tffchallenge.com/posts/text/detail/81/#.VB8YY_LeX2M"><span style="color:green">team</span></a> of students from the fields of Food Science, Information Science, Electrical Engineering, and Agricultural Economics to submit a project proposal for the 2013 <a href="http://tffchallenge.com"><span style="color:green">Thought for Food Challenge</span></a> (TFF). The challenge consisted in coming up with a bold solution to the question **How are we going to feed 9 billion people by 2050?**. Our team tackled the challenge  


Our team tackled the challenge by trying to make more out of the food we already produce: food waste in the developed world is valued at **$168 billion**, out of which households account for $54 billion while agriculture and retail each account for less than $45 billion. End consumers are the biggest wasters in the developed world, and there are currently very few initiatives to empower them even though they are the ultimate bottleneck to our economically driven food system. Household food waste is mainly due to the fact that there is a convenience and an incentive barrier to doing the right thing.

While our team was not selected as one of the 5 finalists who were able to pitch for a chance to win $10,000 in seed capital, we were awarded a special recognition prize that came in the form of a sponsorship to attend the TFF Global Summit in Berlin, Germany with all expenses paid. We had the opportunity to connect with a truly fantastic network of passionate and driven young people, as well as get inspired by an <a href="http://tffchallenge.com/summit"><span style="color:green">impressive panel of speakers</span></a>. Our project also ended up being voted as most original idea at a poster session held at the Summit, which allowed us to pitch Tooskee for feedback to the entire audience.

The team members went on separate ways a couple of months after the Summit, but I still continue to work on the project as a hobby, hoping to one day have a prototype that I would love to use myself! I am also still involved with TFF as an ambassador.
