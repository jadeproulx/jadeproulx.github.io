The <a href="http://tffchallenge.com"><span style="color:green">Thought for Food Challenge</span></a> (TFF) challenge consists in asking international student teams to come up with a bold solution to the question: **How are we going to feed 9 billion people by 2050?** 

In 2013, I assembled a multidisciplinary <a href="http://tffchallenge.com/posts/text/detail/81/#.VB8YY_LeX2M"><span style="color:green">team</span></a> of students from the fields of Food Science, Information Science, Electrical Engineering, and Agricultural Economics to submit a project proposal focused on making more out of the food we already produce: food waste in the developed world is valued at **$168 billion**, out of which households account for $54 billion. **End consumers are the biggest wasters in the developed world**, and there are currently few initiatives to empower them even though they are the ultimate bottleneck to our economically driven food system. Household food waste is due to a convenience and an incentive barrier, and our project <a href="http://www.tooskee.com"><span style="color:green">Tooskee</span></a> tried to overcome both:

While our team was not selected as one of the 5 finalists who were able to pitch for a chance to win $10,000 in seed capital, we were awarded a special recognition prize that came in the form of a sponsorship to attend the <a href="http://www.tffchallenge.com/documentary"><span style="color:green">TFF Global Summit</span></a> in Berlin, Germany with all expenses paid. We had the opportunity to connect with a truly fantastic network of passionate and driven young people, as well as get inspired by an <a href="http://tffchallenge.com/summit"><span style="color:green">impressive panel of speakers</span></a>. Our project also ended up being voted as the most original idea at a poster session held at the Summit, which allowed us to pitch Tooskee for feedback to the entire audience.

The team members went their separate ways a couple of months after the Summit, but I still continue to work on the project as a hobby, hoping to one day have a prototype that I would love to use myself! I am also still involved with TFF as an ambassador.
