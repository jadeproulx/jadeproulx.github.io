I was a part of the second cohort of <a href="http://www.thenext36.ca"><span style="color:green">The Next 36: *Canada's Entrepreneurial Leadership Initiative*</span></a>, a Canadian accelerator program held at the University of Toronto. Every year, they select 36 undergraduates from a pool of 1000+ applicants coming from universities nationwide and from a wide range of academic fields. The selected participants are put into multidisciplinary teams and given seed capital to start a web or mobile company, with the thinking that business, entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial thinking are best taught by "doing". 

With the initial seed capital, my co-founders and I created <a href="http://atl.us"><span style="color:green">Atlus</span></a>, an iPhone app providing high-fidelity restaurant recommendations that attracted users all across North America.

The app was acquired by Ottawa-based Purple Forge Corp in September 2013.
