I was a part of the second cohort of <a href="http://www.thenext36.ca"><span style="color:green">The Next 36: *Canada's Entrepreneurial Leadership Initiative*</span></a>, a Canadian accelerator program held at the University of Toronto. Every year, they select 36 undergraduates from a pool of 1000+ applicants coming from universities nationwide and from a wide range of academic fields. The selected participants are put into multidisciplinary teams and given seed capital to start a web or mobile company, with the thinking that business, entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial thinking are best taught by doing. 

With the initial seed capital, my co-founders and I created <a href="http://atl.us"><span style="color:green">Atlus</span></a>, an iPhone app providing high-fidelity restaurant recommendations that attracted users all across North America. I was mainly responsible for analyzing the usage data in order to drive product development and to maintain a feedback loop with our users. I eventually left the company to go to Graduate School and get back to my food science roots. The app was later <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/blog/next-36-graduate-atlus-acquired-by-ottawas-purple-forge-corp-2013-11-19"><span style="color:green">acquired</span></a> by Ottawa-based Purple Forge Corp.
