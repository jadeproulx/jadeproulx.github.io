In 2012, I was selected to be a part of the second cohort of <a href=""><span style="color:green">The Next 36</span></a>: *Canada's Entrepreneurial Leadership Initiative*. Every year, 36 students selected from a pool of 1,000+ applicants nationwide are challenged to build a technology business for the mobile market in nine months. My co-founders and I created <a href="http://atl.us"><span style="color:green">Atlus</span></a>, an iPhone app providing high-fidelity restaurant recommendations that attracted users all across North America.

The app was acquired by Ottawa-based Purple Forge Corp in September 2013.
