While I was president of the <a href="http://mcgillfsa.wix.com/home"><span style="color:green">McGill Food Science Association</span></a>, we organized a <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/macdonald/events/foodscisymposium"><span style="color:green">Gastronomy & Science Symposium</span></a> open to the public to celebrate the department's 25th Anniversary. This was the biggest event organized by the association up to this date, which required building relationships with the alumni office and potential sponsors from scratch. We secured 3 renowned guest speakers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervé_This"><span style="color:green">Dr. Hervé This</span></a>, father of Molecular Gastronomy, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ekeg45fe/maxime-bilet-head-chef-the-cooking-lab-29/"><span style="color:green">Maxime Bilet</span></a>, chef at Modernist Cuisine, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_A._Schwarcz"><span style="color:green">Dr. Joe Schwarcz</span></a>, prolific author and popular science educator.

> "I cannot express how proud I am of the accomplishment of this group to have organized such an exciting and memorable event. All was flawless and professional and you have put Food Science on the radar at McGill, something I was never able to do in any effective manner. [...] Again I want to thank and congratulate you all on the marvelous and professional event you have organized, which for me represented unexpected fruit from a seed planted many years ago, allowing me to leave with a sense of accomplishment and without any regrets."
- Dr. Frederick R. van de Voort, founding professor of the McGill Food Science Department*
