My research focuses on finding applied solutions to the big challenges facing the food industry and our food system, in general. I am currently developing energy-efficient surface decontamination treatments to <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/pulsedlight"><span style="color:green">prevent wasteful food recalls</span></a>, while my undergraduate research experience involved helping the industry meet its <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/saltenhancer"><span style="color:green">sodium reduction</span></a> targets and understanding the <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/FTIR"><span style="color:green">structure-functionality relationship of under-utilized proteins</span></a>.

## Light-based treatments for microbial on cheese surface
I am currently completing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) in the area of Food Safety Engineering. My work involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of energy efficient non-thermal treatments such as **Pulsed Light** and **LED blue light** on **cheese** surface.  

Of particular interest are questions such as:  
*  How do different microorganisms respond to light-based treatments?  
*  Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of light?  
*  How does the substrate's surface topography influence the effectiveness of different light treatments?  
*  Are hurdle strategies combining light treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than light alone?  
*  How does light affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?  

In the course of this work I have used varied statistical methods to design my experiments and interpret my results, including **multiple linear regression** and **survival analysis**. I also trained, managed, and mentored 6 undergraduate research assistants individually and in teams.
