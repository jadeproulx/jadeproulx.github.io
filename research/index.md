## Development of light-based combination treatments for microbial control on cheese surface

I am currently completing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) in the area of Food Safety Engineering. My work involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of energy efficient non-thermal treatments such as **Pulsed Light** and **LED blue light** on **cheese** surface.

## Quantitative analysis of a commercial salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes [[<span style="color:green">pdf</span>](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51364198/Research%20Report_Jade%20Proulx.pdf)]

My undergraduate research thesis was done in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com) and consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes. The project involved adapting an **enzymatic and colorimetric detection method** that used glycerol as a marker for this particular application.

## FTIR Spectroscopy analysis of a cookie model system
There is an increasing demand for high-protein food products where the consumers' mentality is "the more protein, the better". However, there is a limit to how much protein a dough system can hold without losing its characteristic rheological and organoleptic properties. Milk proteins, particularly whey proteins such as &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin, are readily available and make great protein supplements. As an undergraduate researcher, I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez working under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail) analyzing a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using FPA-FTIR spectroscopy.
