My research focuses on finding applied solutions to big challenges facing the food industry. I am currently developing surface decontamination treatments to <a href="#PulsedLight">**prevent wasteful food recalls**</a>, while my undergraduate research experience involved helping the industry meet its <a href="#sodium">**sodium reduction**</a> targets and understanding the structure-functionality relationship of <a href="#protein">**under-utilized proteins**</a>.

## <a name="PulsedLight">Light-based treatments for microbial control on cheese surface</a>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ([<span style="color:green">FDA</span>](http://www.fda.gov)) has approved the use of Pulsed Light (PL), a non-thermal, non-destructive, and chemical-free technology capable of inactivating microorganisms on surfaces, since 1996 ([<span style="color:green">21 CFR 179.41</span>](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=179.41)). It is currently being used commercially to sterilize food contact surfaces such as [<span style="color:green">bottle caps and lids</span>](http://www.claranor.com/sterilization-of-capping-systems). PL is not yet being used on food products directly because their composition and surface characteristics have a much wider range than pure plastic polymers, thus making PL effectiveness vary greatly from one commodity to another. This element of complexity necessitates thorough testing every time PL is considered for a new food application, and my work has focused on evaluating how different process parameters and treatment conditions affect PL effectiveness on pasteurized milk cheeses, specifically. 

While a lot of attention is given to the risks associated with consuming raw milk cheeses, cheese products made from pasteurized milk are also a [<span style="color:green">non-negligible source of risk</span>](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/fpd.2013.1650) since they are susceptible to post-pasteurization surface contamination during cutting, handling, and packaging. So far, relying solely on [<span style="color:green">Good Manufacturing Practices</span>](http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/cgmp/ucm2006830.htm) after pasteurization has had shortcomings and has lead to both <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-09-12/index.html"><span style="color:green">food safety issues</span></a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/22/blue-mozzarella-investiga_n_618484.html"><span style="color:green">significant losses</span></a> due to spoilage and recalls. The work I conduct under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) for my Masters thesis involves investigating whether PL could be applied as a terminal kill-step in processing and retail environments to address this issue. 

By designing and conducting appropriate inactivation studies, I tried to answer the following questions:  
1. *How do pathogens of specific interest to the cheese industry respond to PL treatment?*  
2. *How do different cheeses' surface topography influence the effectiveness of PL treatment?*  
3. *How does PL affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?*  
4. *Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of PL?* 
4. *Are hurdle strategies combining PL treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than PL alone?*  
5. *How does PL compare to other available light-based treatments such as continuous UV-light and blue LEDs?*

In the course of this work, I have supervised 6 undergraduates individually and in teams, gained experience with multivariate experimental design (DOE) and results interpretation, and presented my findings at 2 academic conferences, <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/publications/#ADSA"><span style="color:green">ADSA</span></a> and <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/publications/#IUFoST"><span style="color:green">IUFoST</span></a>.

## <a name="sodium">Quantitative analysis of a salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes</a>
Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and has been <a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/Salt_Report_VC_april07.pdf"><span style="color:green">identified by the WHO</span></a> as the leading preventable risk factor for death in the world. With such claims, <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/legislation/guide-ld/2012-sodium-reduction-indust-eng.php"><span style="color:green">the food industry is under tremendous pressure</span></a> to reduce the sodium content of its products. One way the food industry is tackling this challenge is by replacing part of the sodium with flavor systems containing salt enhancers. However, coming up with a salt enhancer formulation is only part of the solution: the formulation must also come with a proven quantitative analytical method to ensure every batch using this ingredient will offer a consistent saltiness. Few flavour compounds have already been studied as markers for quantitative analytical purposes, but an alternative is to supplement the formulation with a suitable marker.  

Glycerol has already been largely studied as an indicator of triglyceride levels in blood plasma, and it can be identified using very simple and rapid techniques such as colorimetry, which is ideal for fast-paced industrial testing environments. My undergraduate research thesis, done under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Varoujan Yaylayan</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/varoujan-yaylayan) and in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com), consisted in validating whether a method developed by [<span style="color:green">Winartasaputra et al.</span>](http://www.clinchem.org/content/26/5/613.full.pdf) to detect glycerol in blood plasma could be adapted to suit the food industry's needs. More precisely, I had to develop an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a specific proprietary salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes, a vegetable renowned for being processed into extremely salty foods like french fries and chips.

## <a name="protein">ATR-FTIR spectroscopic analysis of a cookie model system</a>
Not so long ago, whey produced during the cheesemaking process was considered a waste product. Due to significant technological progress in terms of industrial isolation and purification techniques, whey proteins, principally &alpha;-lactalbumin and  &beta;-lactoglobulin, are now <a href="https://www.usdec.org/Products/content.cfm?ItemNumber=82497&navItemNumber=82256"><span style="color:green">readily available</span></a> to be used as supplements. This goes hand-in-hand with the current <a href="http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/us-consumers-have-a-healthy-appetite-for-high-protein-food-the-us-leads-the-way-in-global-launches-of-high-protein-products"><span style="color:green">demand</span></a> for sustainable, high-protein foods. However, isolating new protein sources is only part of the challenge: proteins do not all behave the same way in food matrices and their functionality is mainly dictated by their structure. There is a need to better understand the structure-functionality relationship of whey proteins, especially if food products are to be supplemented with them in very high amounts.

In 2010, I was an undergraduate researcher in the lab of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail) who is the co-director of the [<span style="color:green">McGill IR Group</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/mcgill-ir-group) and whose work revolves around the investigation of food systems at the molecular level. I helped PhD candidate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=129633890&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=zY1-&locale=fr_FR&trk=tyah2&trkInfo=tarId%3A1411245487445%2Ctas%3Adiana%20va%2Cidx%3A1-4-4"><span style="color:green">Diana Valtierra Rodriguez</span></a> analyze a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, a technique that allows for the molecular analysis of low-transmittance, solid samples with minimal preparation. The work I conducted took advantage of this technique to analyze the changes occurring in a cookie model system before and after heat is applied without interference from any harsh sample preparation procedures.
