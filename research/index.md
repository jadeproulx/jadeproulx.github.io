My research focuses on finding applied solutions to the big challenges facing the food industry. I am currently developing energy-efficient surface decontamination treatments to **prevent wasteful food recalls**, while my undergraduate research experience involved helping the industry meet its **sodium reduction** targets and understanding the structure-functionality relationship of **under-utilized proteins**.

## Light-based treatments for microbial control on cheese surface
The FDA has approved the use of Pulsed Light, a non-thermal, non-destructive, and chemical-free technology capable of inactivating microorganisms on surfaces since 1996 ([<span style="color:green">21 CFR 179.41</span>](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=179.41)) and it is currently being used commercially to sterilize food contact surfaces such as [<span style="color:green">bottle caps</span>](http://www.claranor.com/sterilization-of-capping-systems). However PL is not yet being used on food products directly because their composition and surface characteristics have a much wider range than pure plastic polymers, thus making PL effectiveness vary greatly from one commodity to another. This element of complexity necessitates thorough testing every time PL is considered for a new food application, and my work has focused on evaluating how different process parameters and treatment conditions affect PL effectiveness on pasteurized milk cheeses, specifically. 

While a lot of attention is given to the risks associated with consuming raw milk cheeses, cheese products made from pasteurized milk are also a [<span style="color:green">non-negligible source of risk</span>](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/fpd.2013.1650) since they are susceptible to post-pasteurization surface contamination during cutting, handling, and packaging. So far, relying solely on [<span style="color:green">Good Manufacturing Practices</span>](http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/cgmp/ucm2006830.htm) after pasteurization has had shortcomings and has lead to both <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-09-12/index.html"><span style="color:green">food safety issues</span></a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/22/blue-mozzarella-investiga_n_618484.html"><span style="color:green">significant losses</span></a> due to spoilage and recalls. The work I conduct under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) for my Masters thesis involves investigating whether Pulsed Light (PL) could be applied as a terminal kill-step in processing and retail environments to address this issue. 

Of particular interest are questions such as:  

1. *How do pathogens of specific interest to the cheese industry respond to PL treatments?*
2. *How do different cheeses' surface topography influence the effectiveness of PL treatment?*
2. *How does PL affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?*
3. *Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of PL?* 
4. *Are hurdle strategies combining PL treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than PL alone?*  .   
6. *How does PL compare to other available light-based treatments such as continuous UV-light and LED blue light?*

In the course of this work, I have supervised 6 undergraduates individually and in teams, gained experience with multivariate experimental design (DOE) and results interpretation, and presented my findings at 2 academic conferences (<a href="http://www.jtmtg.org/JAM/2014/abstracts/0325-0333.pdf"><span style="color:green">ADSA</span></a>, <a href="https://iufost2014.pathable.com/meetings/217113"><span style="color:green">IUFoST</span></a>).

## Quantitative analysis of a salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes
Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, and has been <a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/Salt_Report_VC_april07.pdf"><span style="color:green">identified by the WHO</span></a> as the leading preventable risk factor for death in the world. With such claims, <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/legislation/guide-ld/2012-sodium-reduction-indust-eng.php"><span style="color:green">the food industry is under tremendous pressure</span></a> to reduce the sodium content of its products. One way the food industry is tackling this challenge is by replacing part of the sodium with flavor systems containing salt enhancers. However, food companies cannot add new ingredients in their production line without being able to quantify how much ends up in their final product. 

My undergraduate research thesis was done in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com) and consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes. The project involved adapting an enzymatic and colorimetric detection method that used glycerol as a marker.

## FTIR spectroscopic analysis of a cookie model system
In 2010, I was an undergraduate volunteer researcher in the lab of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail) who is the co-director of the McGill IR Group. His lab is mostly involved in the investigation of food systems at the molecular level. 

Whey proteins are a by-product of cheese making and (...)
I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez analyze a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, in the hope of better understanding the structure-functionality relationship of these readily available milk proteins.

There is an increasing demand for high-protein food products where the consumers' mentality is "the more protein, the better". However, there is a limit to how much protein a dough system can hold without losing its characteristic rheological and organoleptic properties. Milk proteins, particularly whey proteins such as &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin, are readily available and make great protein supplements.
