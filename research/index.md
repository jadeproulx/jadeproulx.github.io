My research focuses on finding applied solutions to the big challenges facing the food industry. I am currently developing energy-efficient surface decontamination treatments to <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/pulsedlight"><span style="color:green">prevent wasteful food recalls</span></a>, while my undergraduate research experience involved helping the industry meet its <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/saltenhancer"><span style="color:green">sodium reduction</span></a> targets and understanding the <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/FTIR"><span style="color:green">structure-functionality relationship of under-utilized proteins</span></a>.

## Light-based treatments for microbial on cheese surface
Cheese products made from pasteurized milk are susceptible to post-processing surface contamination that can lead to both food safety issues and significant losses due to spoilage. The work I conduct under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) in the area of Food Safety Engineering involves investigating whether Pulsed Light, a non-thermal, non-destructive, and chemical-free treatment, could be a viable solution to address this issue. Of particular interest are questions such as: 
*How do different microorganisms respond to light-based treatments?*  
*Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of light?*  
*How does the substrate's surface topography influence the effectiveness of different light treatments?*  
*Are hurdle strategies combining light treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than light alone?*  
*How does light affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?*  

In the course of this work I have used varied statistical methods to design my experiments and interpret my results, including **multiple linear regression** and **survival analysis**. I also trained, managed, and mentored 6 undergraduate research assistants individually and in teams.  

## Quantitative analysis of a salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes
My undergraduate research thesis was done in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com) and consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes. The project involved adapting an **enzymatic and colorimetric detection method** that used glycerol as a marker for this particular application.

## FTIR spectroscopic analysis of a cookie model system
In 2010, I was an undergraduate volunteer researcher in the lab of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail) who is the co-director of the McGill IR Group. His lab is mostly involved in the investigation of food systems at the molecular level. I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez analyze a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, in the hope of better understanding the structure-functionality relationship of these readily available milk proteins.

There is an increasing demand for high-protein food products where the consumers' mentality is "the more protein, the better". However, there is a limit to how much protein a dough system can hold without losing its characteristic rheological and organoleptic properties. Milk proteins, particularly whey proteins such as &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin, are readily available and make great protein supplements.
