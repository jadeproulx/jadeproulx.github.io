### Development of light-based combination treatments for microbial control on cheese surface

I am currently completing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) in the area of Food Safety Engineering. My work involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of light-based, non-thermal treatments such as Pulsed Light and LED blue light on cheese surface. Of particular interest are questions such as:
- How do different microorganisms respond to light-based treatments?
- Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of light?
- How does the substrate's surface topography influence the effectiveness of different light treatments?
- Are hurdle strategies combining light treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than light alone?
- How does light affect important cheese quality attributes such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?

In the course of this work I have used varied statistical methods to design my experiments and interpret my results, including multiple linear regression and survival analysis. I also trained, managed, and mentored 6 research assistants individually and in teams.
