### Development of light-based combination treatments for microbial control on cheese surface

I am currently completing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) in the area of Food Safety Engineering. My work involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of energy efficient non-thermal treatments such as **Pulsed Light** and **LED blue light** on **cheese** surface. Of particular interest are questions such as:  

1. *How do different microorganisms respond to light-based treatments?*  
2. *Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of light?*  
3. *How does the substrate's surface topography influence the effectiveness of different light treatments?*  
4. *Are hurdle strategies combining light treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than light alone?*  
5. *How does light affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?*  

In the course of this work I have used varied statistical methods to design my experiments and interpret my results, including **multiple linear regression** and **survival analysis**. I also trained, managed, and mentored 6 undergraduate research assistants individually and in teams.   


### Quantitative analysis of a commercial salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes [[<span style="color:green">pdf</span>](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51364198/Research%20Report_Jade%20Proulx.pdf)]

My undergraduate research thesis was done in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com) and consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer's was absorbed by potatoes.
