My research focuses on finding applied solutions to big challenges facing the food industry. I am currently developing surface decontamination treatments to <a href="#PulsedLight">**prevent wasteful food recalls**</a>, while my undergraduate research experience involved helping the industry meet its <a href="#sodium">**sodium reduction**</a> targets and understanding the structure-functionality relationship of <a href="#protein">**under-utilized proteins**</a>.

## <a name="PulsedLight">Light-based treatments for microbial control on cheese surface</a>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ([<span style="color:green">FDA</span>](http://www.fda.gov)) has approved the use of Pulsed Light (PL), a non-thermal, non-destructive, and chemical-free technology capable of inactivating microorganisms on surfaces, since 1996 ([<span style="color:green">21 CFR 179.41</span>](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=179.41)). It is currently being used commercially to sterilize food contact surfaces such as [<span style="color:green">bottle caps and lids</span>](http://www.claranor.com/sterilization-of-capping-systems). PL is not yet being used on food products directly because their composition and surface characteristics have a much wider range than pure plastic polymers, thus making PL effectiveness vary greatly from one commodity to another. This element of complexity necessitates thorough testing every time PL is considered for a new food application. The work I conduct under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) for my Masters thesis has focused on evaluating how different process parameters and treatment conditions affect PL effectiveness on pasteurized milk cheeses, specifically. 

By designing and conducting appropriate inactivation studies, I tried to answer the following questions:  
1. *How do pathogens of specific interest to the cheese industry respond to PL treatment?*  
2. *How do different cheeses' surface topography influence the effectiveness of PL treatment?*  
3. *How does PL affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?*  
4. *Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of PL?*  
5. *Are hurdle strategies combining PL treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than PL alone?*  
6. *How does PL compare to other available light-based treatments such as continuous UV-light and blue LEDs?*  

I presented my findings at 2 academic conferences, <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/publications/#ADSA"><span style="color:green">ADSA</span></a> and <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/publications/#IUFoST"><span style="color:green">IUFoST</span></a>, and 2 journal articles reporting my results are currently in the works.

## <a name="sodium">Quantitative analysis of a salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes</a>
Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and has been <a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/Salt_Report_VC_april07.pdf"><span style="color:green">identified by the WHO</span></a> as the leading preventable risk factor for death in the world. With such claims, <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/legislation/guide-ld/2012-sodium-reduction-indust-eng.php"><span style="color:green">the food industry is under tremendous pressure</span></a> to reduce the sodium content of its products. One way the food industry is tackling this challenge is by replacing part of the sodium with flavor systems containing salt enhancers. However, coming up with a salt enhancer formulation is only part of the solution: the formulation must also come with a proven quantitative analytical method to measure how much of it is absorbed by the food matrix of interest, and thus ensure every batch using this ingredient will offer a consistent taste profile. Few flavour compounds have already been studied as markers for quantitative analytical purposes, but an alternative is to *supplement* the formulation with a suitable marker. Glycerol is an interesting candidate since it has already been largely studied as an indicator of triglyceride levels in blood plasma, and it can be identified using very simple and rapid techniques such as colorimetry, which is ideal for fast-paced industrial testing environments. 

My undergraduate research thesis, done under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Varoujan Yaylayan</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/varoujan-yaylayan) and in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com), consisted in validating whether a method developed by [<span style="color:green">Winartasaputra et al.</span>](http://www.clinchem.org/content/26/5/613.full.pdf) to detect glycerol in blood plasma could be adapted to quantify how much of a proprietary salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes, a vegetable renowned for being processed into extremely salty foods like french fries and chips. At the laboratory-scale, I was able to use this adapted method to determine the concentration of salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes with a 90% accuracy, which was considered a success by our commercial partner. However, scaling up the method proved more challenging and the colorimetric method I adapted failed to produce reliable results at an industrial scale.

## <a name="protein">ATR-FTIR spectroscopic analysis of a cookie model system</a>
FTIR Spectroscopy is a well-established technique to analyze matter at the molecular level but can sometimes require involved sample preparation procedures when it comes to solid, low-transmittance materials like food, which prevents its use for dynamic systems. Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy circumvents this limitation and opens new possibilities, such as analyzing the molecular changes occurring when heating solid foods like a dough, for example.  

In 2010, I was a volunteer undergraduate researcher in the lab of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail), whose work revolves around the investigation of food systems at the molecular level. I got exposure to ATR-FTIR spectroscopy by assisting PhD candidate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=129633890&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=zY1-&locale=fr_FR&trk=tyah2&trkInfo=tarId%3A1411245487445%2Ctas%3Adiana%20va%2Cidx%3A1-4-4"><span style="color:green">Diana Valtierra Rodriguez</span></a> in her work on the analysis of the structure-functionality relationship of whey proteins, which not so long ago were considered a waste product of cheese production. Specifically, I prepared samples of an egg-free cookie dough fortified with the principal whey proteins &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin according to previously determined SOPs, I documented visual differences during the baking process of 15 different formulations, and I interpreted ATR-FTIR outputs of both the raw and baked dough.
