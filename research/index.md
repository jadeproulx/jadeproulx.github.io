## Light-based treatments for microbial control on cheese surface
My graduate work as a Masters student involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of energy efficient non-thermal treatments such as **Pulsed Light** and **LED blue light** on **cheese** surface. <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/pulsedlight"><span style="color:green">Learn more</span></a>


## Quantitative analysis of a salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes
My undergraduate research thesis consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes. <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/saltenhancer"><span style="color:green">Learn more</span></a>

## FTIR Spectroscopy analysis of a cookie model system
As an undergraduate researcher, I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez analyzing a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using FPA-FTIR spectroscopy.
