## Light-based treatments for microbial control on cheese surface
My graduate work involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of energy efficient, non-thermal treatments such as Pulsed Light and LED blue light on cheese surface. <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/pulsedlight"><span style="color:green">Learn more</span></a>

## Quantitative analysis of a salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes
My undergraduate research thesis consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes. <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/research/saltenhancer"><span style="color:green">Learn more</span></a>

## FTIR Spectroscopy analysis of a cookie model system
As an undergraduate researcher, I worked in the lab of Dr. Ashraf Ismail who is the co-director of the McGill IR Group. His lab is mostly involved in food analysis and the investigation of food systems at the molecular level. I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez analyze a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using FPA-FTIR spectroscopy, in the hope of understanding better the structure-functionality relationship of these readily available milk proteins.
