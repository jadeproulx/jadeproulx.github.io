The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ([<span style="color:green">FDA</span>](http://www.fda.gov)) has approved the use of Pulsed Light (PL), a non-thermal, non-destructive, and chemical-free technology capable of inactivating microorganisms on surfaces, since 1996 ([<span style="color:green">21 CFR 179.41</span>](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=179.41)). It is currently being used commercially to sterilize food contact surfaces such as [<span style="color:green">bottle caps and lids</span>](http://www.claranor.com/sterilization-of-capping-systems). PL is not yet being used on food products directly because their composition and surface characteristics have a much wider range than pure plastic polymers, thus making PL effectiveness vary greatly from one commodity to another. This element of complexity necessitates thorough testing every time PL is considered for a new food application, and my work has focused on evaluating how different process parameters and treatment conditions affect PL effectiveness on pasteurized milk cheeses, specifically. 

While a lot of attention is given to the risks associated with consuming raw milk cheeses, cheese products made from pasteurized milk are also a [<span style="color:green">non-negligible source of risk</span>](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/fpd.2013.1650) since they are susceptible to post-pasteurization surface contamination during cutting, handling, and packaging. So far, relying solely on [<span style="color:green">Good Manufacturing Practices</span>](http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/cgmp/ucm2006830.htm) after pasteurization has had shortcomings and has lead to both <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-09-12/index.html"><span style="color:green">food safety issues</span></a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/22/blue-mozzarella-investiga_n_618484.html"><span style="color:green">significant losses</span></a> due to spoilage and recalls. The work I conduct under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) for my Masters thesis involves investigating whether PL could be applied as a terminal kill-step in processing and retail environments to address this issue. Of particular interest are questions such as:  

1. *How do pathogens of specific interest to the cheese industry respond to PL treatment?*
2. *How do different cheeses' surface topography influence the effectiveness of PL treatment?*
2. *How does PL affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?*
3. *Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of PL?* 
4. *Are hurdle strategies combining PL treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than PL alone?*  .   
6. *How does PL compare to other available light-based treatments such as continuous UV-light and blue LEDs?*

In the course of this work, I have supervised 6 undergraduates individually and in teams, gained experience with multivariate experimental design (DOE) and results interpretation, and presented my findings at 2 academic conferences (<a href="http://www.jtmtg.org/JAM/2014/abstracts/0325-0333.pdf"><span style="color:green">ADSA</span></a>, <a href="https://iufost2014.pathable.com/meetings/217113"><span style="color:green">IUFoST</span></a>).
