I am currently completing my Master's thesis under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span>](http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/) in the area of Food Safety Engineering. My work involves analyzing how different treatment conditions and process parameters influence the effectiveness of energy efficient non-thermal treatments such as **Pulsed Light** and **LED blue light** on **cheese** surface.  

Of particular interest are questions such as:  

*  How do different microorganisms respond to light-based treatments?  

*  Does the presence of LDPE-packaging diminish the bactericidal effect of light?  

*  How does the substrate's surface topography influence the effectiveness of different light treatments?  

*  Are hurdle strategies combining light treatments with natural antimicrobials more effective than light alone?  

*  How does light affect important physico-chemical quality attributes of cheese such as color, oxidative stability, vitamin content, and onset of molding?  

In the course of this work I have used varied statistical methods to design my experiments and interpret my results, including **multiple linear regression** and **survival analysis**. I also trained, managed, and mentored 6 undergraduate research assistants individually and in teams.
