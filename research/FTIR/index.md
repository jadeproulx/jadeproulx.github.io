There is an increasing demand for high-protein food products where the consumers' mentality is "the more protein, the better". However, there is a limit to how much protein a dough system can hold without losing its characteristic rheological and organoleptic properties. Milk proteins, particularly whey proteins such as &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin, are readily available and make great protein supplements. As an undergraduate researcher, I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez working under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail) analyzing a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using FPA-FTIR spectroscopy.
