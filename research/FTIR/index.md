In 2010, I was an undergraduate volunteer researcher in the lab of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Ashraf Ismail</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/ashraf-ismail) who is the co-director of the McGill IR Group. His lab is mostly involved in the investigation of food systems at the molecular level. 

I helped PhD Candidate Diana Valtierra Rodriguez analyze a cookie model system containing high levels of &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, in the hope of better understanding the structure-functionality relationship of these readily available milk proteins.

There is an increasing demand for high-protein food products where the consumers' mentality is "the more protein, the better". However, there is a limit to how much protein a dough system can hold without losing its characteristic rheological and organoleptic properties. Milk proteins, particularly whey proteins such as &beta;-lactoglobulin and &alpha;-lactalbumin, are readily available and make great protein supplements.
