Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and has been <a href="http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/Salt_Report_VC_april07.pdf"><span style="color:green">identified by the WHO</span></a> as the leading preventable risk factor for death in the world. With such claims, <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/legislation/guide-ld/2012-sodium-reduction-indust-eng.php"><span style="color:green">the food industry is under tremendous pressure</span></a> to reduce the sodium content of its products. 

One way the food industry is tackling this challenge is by replacing part of the sodium with flavor systems containing salt enhancers. However, coming up with a salt enhancer formulation is only part of the solution: the formulation must also come with a proven quantitative analytical method to ensure every batch using this ingredient will offer a consistent saltiness. Few flavour compounds have already been studied as markers for quantitative analytical purposes. Hence, the most suitable way to determine how much of a complex salt enhancer mixture has been absorbed by a food matrix is to supplement it with a suitable marker. 

Glycerol has already been largely studied as an indicator of triglyceride levels in blood plasma, and it can be identified using very simple and rapid techniques such as colorimetry, which is ideal for fast-paced industrial testing environments. My undergraduate research thesis done under the supervision of [<span style="color:green">Dr. Varoujan Yaylayan</span>](http://www.mcgill.ca/foodscience/staff-and-research/varoujan-yaylayan) and in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com) thus consisted in validating whether a method developed by [<span style="color:green">Winartasaputra et al.</span>](http://www.clinchem.org/content/26/5/613.full.pdf) to detect glycerol in blood plasma could be adapted to suit the food industry's needs. More precisely, I had to develop an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a specific proprietary salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes.
