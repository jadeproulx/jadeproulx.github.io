## Quantitative analysis of a commercial salt enhancer's uptake by potatoes [[<span style="color:green">pdf</span>](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51364198/Research%20Report_Jade%20Proulx.pdf)]

My undergraduate research thesis was done in partnership with [<span style="color:green">Novotaste Inc.</span>](http://www.novotaste.com) and consisted in developing an accurate, rapid, and affordable analytical method that could quantify how much of a salt enhancer was absorbed by potatoes. The project involved adapting an **enzymatic and colorimetric detection method** that used glycerol as a marker for this particular application.
