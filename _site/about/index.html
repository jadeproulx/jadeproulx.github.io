<p>I am a Masters student in Food Science at Cornell University. My current work involves developing novel strategies for the surface decontamination of foods using non-thermal technologies. I have work experience in the food industry, having previously interned in both R&amp;D and QC at two different flavour companies. I have also been involved in numerous food-related entrepreneurial projects such as <a href="http://atl.us">co-founding an exclusive restaurant recommendation app</a>, organizing a Gastronomy &amp; Science symposium, and participating to <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/07/snappy-popples-cracks-first-place-national-food-expo">food product development competitions</a>. My interests lie at the interface between <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>food</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.</p>
