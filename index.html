I am a Masters student in Food Science at Cornell University working under the supervision of <a href="http://blogs.cornell.edu/morarulab/"></a><span style="color:green">Dr. Carmen Moraru</span></a>. My current work involves developing novel strategies for the surface decontamination of foods using non-thermal technologies. I have have previously interned in both R&D and QC at two different flavour companies and I am <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/51364198/HACCP-certificate.jpg"></a><span style="color:green">HACCP-certified</span></a>. I have also been involved in numerous food-related entrepreneurial projects such as co-founding an <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/freetime/Atlus"><span style="color:green">exclusive restaurant recommendation app</span></a>, organizing a <a href="http://jadeproulx.com/freetime/mcgillsymposium"><span style="color:green">Gastronomy & Science Symposium</span></a>, and participating to <a href= "http://jadeproulx.com/freetime/popples"><span style="color:green">food product development competitions</span></a>. My interests lie at the interface between <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>food</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>entrepreneurship</strong>.
